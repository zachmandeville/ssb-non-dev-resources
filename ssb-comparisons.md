# SSB Comparisons

**Objective**

Compare SSB to other popular messaging and social networking clients.  It is not intended as a "HERE'S HOW WE BLOW THEM OUTTA THE WATER!" (though our qualities will be apparent).  It's meant as a helpful way for a new person to get some context on what they can expect to get out of SSB at this time.

Clients to compare to:
- Slack
- Signal
- Mastodon
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Email(?)
- Medium(?)
