# Markdown Style Guide

**Objective**

Offer a standard guide to how to write in markdown, but with the examples using lightly silly and lightly solarpunk examples.

eg.
`I want to __accentuate__ how much I love this post about **AIRSHIPS**`

```
Here is my list of why Frasier is the best TV Show:
   1. points that are an ordered list.
   2. likely about how great Roz is.
   3. Go into the finer points of finer points
   * Using an undordered list
   *to truly show the point
```

Basically, make it so the style guide doesn't feel like reading a legal document.

It would also include ssb specific tips, like what it looks like when you reference another thread, how to attach images, how to link to git-ssb repos (or files within those repos) and how to post to different channels.
