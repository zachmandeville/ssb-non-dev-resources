# SSB Intro Video

**Objective**

Craft a 30sec to 1minute video enthusing upon the awesome things about Scuttlebutt--both the technology and the culture that is fermenting here.  This video is not meant to be educational, but more marketable/excitable.  

The main thrust I'm envisioning now is "The Social Network of the Future, available today."

It leans more on the radical potential of Scuttlebutt, and builds up awesome statements of what the future will be, with Scuttlebutt being a core part of it.

e.g.:

"The Future is Solarpunk"
"The Future is Diverse"
"The Future is Powered by Us and not by Corporations"
"The Future is Equal and Safe"
"The Future Feels Familiar"
"The Future is Fun"
"The Future is Decentralized"
"The Future is Available Today"

I am not yet sure how much imagery of SSB should be used, and how much of this should just be pure _art_ that acts kinda like a manifesto, rather than some tutorial of what scuttlebutt is.

Perhaps there could be a 30 second video as well as an "Extended Cut" that goes into more details of each of these Future Postulates.
