# Onboarding Animation

**Objective**

Simple, step-by-step, explanation of what will happen once you start up Patchwork and get going.  It is intended to live at the top of the revamped homepage, and get people into our 'verse as soon as possible.

Steps:
- Find Patchwork in your Applications (explaining it's an app and not a site)
- Give yourself a name and description (choose whatever you want!)
- Click Join a Pub and put in an invite code (explain what a pub is and isn't, and offer a simple invite code within these steps for them to copy and paste)
- Messages will start downloading.  This will take about 5 minutes.  
- Your are downloading your network onto your computer, essentially.  Be clear with how much space this will likely take, and why.
- Post in #new-People and check otu these other channels! (#cooking-channel, #solarpunk, #offgrid, #feminism, #comics, #past)
- Best thing to do is just state what it is you'd love to talk about.  you'll find some other fan.
