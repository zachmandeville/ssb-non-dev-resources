# How to Throw an SSB Party

**Objective** 

This article is intended for SSB members who want to get more of their friends onto the 'verse.  One of the best ways to onboard friends is to be on the same network as them, and showing how SSB works within the local network.

This article, then, describes the best way to get your friends together and successfully using scuttlebutt.  The article is written somewhat in the style of a Martha Stewart Living Article.  It's focus is on you being a great party host _as well as_ getting folks onto SSB.  The humor is in the goofy enthusiasm the author of the post is putting into this party, and what ridiculous things are needed for it to be a success (hand-made invitations.  Homemade fortune cookies that contain within the password to your wifi.  A specific Scuttlebutt playlist you play, etc.)

While the article woudl be goofy, there is still useful information prominent throughout.  For example, not only getting everyone on the same WIFI but also detailing which ports SSB uses so that if someone can't see everyone else, you can check their firewall and help them get through. It would also recommend sort of "etiquette" tips (choosing names for everyone, but not being an ss about it, for example).
