#Understanding Centralized Models: How to Send an Effective Tweet 

*[Part of SSB-in Context](/ssb-in-context/README.md)* 

**Objective**

Show how to craft a perfect tweet to be seen by your friends.  At the start it will be a simple tweet like "Feeling like some friendship today, who's up for lunch?".

Explains how, when sending a tweet, you are adding it to Twitter's massive database, and twitter then decides how to send this to your friends.  Since they are trying to get people scrolling through their feed for as long as possible (so they can display ads within the feed, as that is the main business model), then they algorithmically determine which tweets will have the most profound, addicting effect on your friends.

Because of this, the tweet first sent seems to get little reply, while you meanwhile are scrolling throough your own feed.  You steadily adjust teh wording of your following tweets to get better numbers (likes and retweets), and to better be seen within this unknowable algorithm.  By the article's end, the most effective tweet is the one that 'games' the system and expresses none of your real feelings at all.
